    "   - Copy over all the **Code** section to the following Code block.\n",
    "   - Download as a Python (`.py`) and copy the code to the following Code block.\n",
    "2. In the bottom right, click the <span style=\"color:blue\">Test Run</span> button. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Didn't Pass\n",
    "If your code didn't pass the test, go back to the previous Concept or to your local setup and continue iterating on your algorithm and try to bring your training error down before testing again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pass\n",
    "If your code passes the test, complete the following! You **must** include a screenshot of your code and the Test being **Passed**. Here is what the starter filler code looks like when the test is run and should be similar. A passed test will include in the notebook a green outline plus a box with **Test passed:** and in the Results bar at the bottom the progress bar will be at 100% plus a checkmark with **All cells passed**.\n",
